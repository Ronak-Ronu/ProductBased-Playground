Closures are often used in scenarios like callbacks, event handlers, and functional programming.\n2. They help in creating private variables and functions, which can’t be accessed from outside the enclosing function.\n3. Understanding closures is key to mastering advanced JavaScript techniques.\nLearning closures will significantly improve your ability to write cleaner and more maintainable code.",
