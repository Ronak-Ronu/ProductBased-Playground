      "bodyofcontent": "What They Do:\n\nCOUNT(*): This function simply counts all the rows in a table, no matter what. It doesn’t care about NULL values or anything else. It just wants to know how many rows there are.\n\nCOUNT(1): This function also counts all the rows in a table. The `1` is just a constant and does not refer to any specific column; it’s merely a placeholder. The database engine treats it the same way as `COUNT(*)`.\n\nPerformance Talk:\nWhen it comes to performance, there’s usually not much of a difference between the two. Modern databases are pretty smart and can handle both just fine. Some folks say `COUNT(1)` might be a tad faster in certain older databases because it’s counting a simple constant value, but honestly, the difference is usually so small that it doesn’t matter much.\n\n\n\n",

      "bodyofcontent": "An Angular tutorial on how to reload/refresh a single component or the entire application and reuse the logic across multiple components.\n\nThere is a lot of difference between reloading a single component and reloading the entire application. We shall see how both can be achieved.\n\nIt's a very simple application. There are 3 components: AppComponent which hosts the TestComponent and the TestComponent hosts the ChildComponent.\n\nWe have just 2 objectives:\n\nAbility to reload the current route, child route, parent route, and entire application.\nUse inheritance to add this functionality inside a single component so that any other component can extend and reuse it.",
