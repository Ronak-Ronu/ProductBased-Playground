      "bodyofcontent": "What They Do:\n\nCOUNT(*): This function simply counts all the rows in a table, no matter what. It doesn’t care about NULL values or anything else. It just wants to know how many rows there are.\n\nCOUNT(1): This function also counts all the rows in a table. The `1` is just a constant and does not refer to any specific column; it’s merely a placeholder. The database engine treats it the same way as `COUNT(*)`.\n\nPerformance Talk:\nWhen it comes to performance, there’s usually not much of a difference between the two. Modern databases are pretty smart and can handle both just fine. Some folks say `COUNT(1)` might be a tad faster in certain older databases because it’s counting a simple constant value, but honestly, the difference is usually so small that it doesn’t matter much.\n\n\n\n",
